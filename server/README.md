Things I learned or practiced in this project:

- Node JS and Express introduction.
- Started my first server in Express.
- Used the nodemon package for the first time and understand it's use.
- Created my first database in mySQL.
- Interacted with the mySQL database to add my first employee.
- Interacted with the mySQL database to extract all the employees and put them in a state variable so I could display all employees in my UI if need be.
- Got more practice using the mySQL workbench to visualise the data I'm sending to the database.
